Thrilled to announce a recent paper of ours investigating **memorization in large language models** has been accepted for publication by this year's ICLR conference. A preprint of this work is available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02159) and a succinct [blog post](https://mansisak.com/memorization/) on its results is also available.
