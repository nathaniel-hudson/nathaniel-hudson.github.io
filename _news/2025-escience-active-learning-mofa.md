Research that explores how active learning methods can improve the rate of novel scientific discovery 
in generative AI workflows has been accepted for publication at the 2025 IEEE e-Science conference.
This paper specifically studies the discovery novel metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) in the MOFA workflows 
presented in an earlier work.
