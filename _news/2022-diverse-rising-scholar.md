I was honored to be nominated and, ultimately, selected for the distinguishment as a Rising Scholar by *Diverse Issues in Higher Education*. I was one of ten students across the country selected for this honor. See below for an excerpt from the profile included in their [publication](https://www.diverseeducation.com/awards-honors/graduate-scholars/2022/article/15289404/an-outsidethebox-thinker).

> Hudson has not only focused on his research in his program but on building a more welcoming graduate student community in his department, particularly for students from underrepresented backgrounds. He has also participated in panels aimed at Black students interested in STEM.
