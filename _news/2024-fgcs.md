Very honored to announce that my paper entitled, "QoS-Aware Edge AI Placement and Scheduling with Multiple Implementations in FaaS-based Edge Computing"
has been recently accepted to appear in the [Future Generation Computer Systems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/future-generation-computer-systems) 
as part of the journal's special issue on **"Serverless Computing in the Cloud-to-Edge Continuum"**. This paper poses the problem of deploying AI models at the edge and then
scheduling requests for them in a QoS-aware manner. The use of federated learning to predict incoming requests is also applied.
