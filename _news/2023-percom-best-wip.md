A recent work I co-authored, entitled "Balancing Federated Learning Trade-Offs for Heterogeneous Environments",
investigated trade-offs associated with _Federated Learning_ (FL) related to system and data/statistical heterogeneity.
More specifically, the work aims to acquire initial insights for simple strategies to balance decisions for how local
training is done on high-power and low-power edge devices in a FL process.

This work as accepted for publication through the
[2023 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications (PerCom)](https://percom.org/2023/)
_Work-in-Progress_ (WiP) session. At the conference's banquet on Thursday, March 16, 2023, it was awarded the
**_Best Paper Award_** for the WiP session of PerCom 2023.
