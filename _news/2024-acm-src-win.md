This last summer, I had the privilege of closely working with Jordan Pettyjohn, an undergraduate student from the Colorado School of Mines.
This was part of the [BigDataX REU program](http://datasys.cs.iit.edu/grants/BigDataX/index.html).
His summer research project focused on using an intepretability framework to identify and address toxicity 
and bias in transformer-based language models. This research was awarded the 1st place prize in the 
ACM *Student Research Competition* (SRC) 

This work was also featured at the 2024 BlackBoxNLP Workshop hosted at this year's EMNLP conference.
