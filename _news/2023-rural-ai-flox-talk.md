I will be giving a talk on federated learning on the Globus Compute platform on October 13th, 2023 as part of the [Rural AI](https://sites.google.com/view/rural-ai/home) _Workshop on Serverless Federated Learning for
Remote Internet-of-Things Applications_ ([click here](https://sites.google.com/view/rural-ai/events?authuser=0) to learn how to attend).
