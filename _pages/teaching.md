### Undergraduate Teaching Assistant (Northern Kentucky University), 2016

Served as a TA for CSC 364 (Data Structures & Algorithms). This course was taught using a team-led, project-based learning model in order to enforce the material of the course in a collaborative and thought-provoking way. As a Teaching Assistant, I was responsible for six groups of students primarily to make sure that these groups were understanding the material and to answer any questions they might have. Along with this role, I was responsible for grading these students' in-class projects and provide feedback throughout the semester.
